##Hello, 

I have recently embarked on the journey of becoming a developer. 

I still have a lot of work to do on this website and will be working on it regularly to apply new skills I pick up 
as I go. I don't know if it's common practice to launch an incomplete website, but I thought it would be beneficial
for me to start using Git/Github and familiarize myself. 

Next Steps:

> First I want to finish building out the layout to be responsive for desktop. (handles re-sized windows to 4k monitors)
> Once the layout is responsive for desktop situations, I will link seperate CSS files for mobile devices and tablets
  utilizing (<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-device-width: xxxx)" href="tablet.css" />)
 > Next I want to plug in content, mainly the contact section and projects.
